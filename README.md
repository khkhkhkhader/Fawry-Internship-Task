# Fawry Internship Task - mygrep.sh

This project is a mini implementation of the `grep` command using Bash scripting.

## Features:
- Case-insensitive search for a string in a text file
- `-n` option: Show line numbers for matches
- `-v` option: Invert match (show lines that do not contain the string)
- Supports combined options like `-vn` and `-nv`
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- `--help` flag displays usage instructions

## ðŸ§  Reflective Section

### 1. How the script handles arguments and options:

A) The code checks if the user Entered --help flag first or not and if it is it will print the help statment of the usage of the script

B) The code will handle the options using while getopt allowing the script to identify -n and -v as options for the program

C) The code will handle arguments as if the arguments are two it will processed any number else of arguments will print invalid input and a help message.
  The Script will also check the file if it's exists and readable or not

### 2. If regex or `-i`, `-c`, `-l` were supported:
- The script would need additional flags.
- `-i` (case-insensitive) would be conditionally added with while getopt instead of being used as default in this line grep_options="-i"

- `-c` (count only) and `-l` (list files) would require additional options appended dynamically to `grep`and additional cases in while getopt.


### 3. Hardest part to implement:
- Parsing options correctly and ensuring that `-v` and `-n` can be combined (`-vn` or `-nv`) without breaking argument processing.
- Controlling options with while getopts was a little bit challenging, and understanding shift $((OPTIND-1)) required deep research before proceeding.

## Usage Examples:

```bash
./mygrep.sh hello testfile.txt
./mygrep.sh -n hello testfile.txt
./mygrep.sh -vn hello testfile.txt
./mygrep.sh --help
